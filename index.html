            <p>Steve Jobs is the authorized self-titled biography of American business
                magnate and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.
                The book was written at the request of Jobs by Walter Isaacson,
                 a former executive at CNN and TIME 
                 who had previously written best-selling 
                 biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein.
                 Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over
                two years—in addition to interviews with more than one hundred family members,
                 friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues—Isaacson was
                  given "unprecedented" access to Jobs's life..
